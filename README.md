# Urban-dictionary
Worked with Angular and API calls.

#About
Urban Dictionary is a crowdsourced online dictionary for slang words and phrases, operating under the motto "Define Your World.". Available on Rapid API, helped me to understand making Api calls from Angular.

#Execution
Download project and run `ng serve -o`.
Note: You must have angular installed already. If not [click here](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local).
